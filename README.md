# Digital-Access-Control

This project was made using ModelSim simulator and testbench to validate results of Phase 1 (which is used later on in the rest of the phases).
Phase 2 and 3 were done using Linux-based distribution Fedora operating system with its needed tools (Alliance) for placement and routing.
